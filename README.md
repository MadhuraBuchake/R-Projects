# R-Projects
Basic R Projects to visualize various data sets and derieve data insights using ggplot, matplot and other packages.

2. Law of Large Numbers

   For N random normally distributed numbers with mean=0 and std=1, count how many of these numbers will fall between -1 and 1 and divide      by total quantity N. Keep increasing the value of N.
   Check if Mean(X) is approx to E(X)
   
3. Financial Data Analysis

   There are two vectors of data: monthly revenue and monthly expenses for a financial year. Calculate the following financial metrics:
   - profit for each month
   - profit after tax for each month (the tax rate is 30%)
   - profit margin for each month - equals to profit a after tax divided by revenue
   - good months - where the profit after tax was greater than the mean for the year
   - bad months - where the profit after tax was less than the mean for the year
   - the best month - where the profit after tax was max for the year
   - the worst month - where the profit after tax was min for the year
   - Results for the profit margin ratio need to be presented in units of % with no
     decimal points.
   
 4. Basketball Data Analysis
 
    Data for two more additional in-game statistics:
   
   • Free Throws
   • Free Throw Attempts
   
   Create three plots that portray the following insights:
   
   • Free Throw Attempts per game
   • Accuracy of Free Throws
   • Player playing style (2 vs 3 points preference) excluding Free Throws*
   
   *Each Free Throw is worth 1 point. The data has been supplied in the form of vectors. Create two matrices before you proceed with the     analysis
